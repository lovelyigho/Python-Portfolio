 Global Remittance Inflow Analysis (1970 – 2017)
 ---------------------------------------------------
 This project analyzes global remittance inflows across countries between
 1970 and 2017 using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib).

 It highlights long-term trends, regional growth patterns, and insights
 into diaspora contributions to national economies.

 The analysis focuses on data cleaning, transformation, visualization, 
 and interpretation to better understand global money-flow dynamics.

-- DATASET INFORMATION

Source: World Bank – Remittance Inflows (1970 – 2017)

Variables: Country Name | Year | Remittance Inflows (USD Million)

Preprocessing steps:
  - Removed missing / duplicate records
  - Standardized country naming conventions
  - Normalized values for consistent comparisons
  - Created aggregations for regional trends

-- KEY INSIGHTS

- Top Countries: India, China, and Mexico consistently dominate global inflows.
- Nigeria’s Growth showed Massive surge after 2004, stabilizing around $32B annually by 2010.
- Global Peak: Remittance inflows reached their highest point in 2014 ($597.7B USD).
- Insight: Remittances play a key role in financial inclusion & diaspora-driven development.
